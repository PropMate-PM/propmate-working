  # Fix Anonymous User Submissions

  1. Problem
    - The critical security fixes migration removed the policy that allowed anonymous users to submit cashback requests
    - This breaks the core functionality for users who aren't logged in

  2. Solution
    - Add back a policy for anonymous users to insert submissions
    - Maintain security by ensuring proper validation at application level
    - Keep existing authenticated user policies intact

-- Add policy for anonymous users to submit cashback requests
CREATE POLICY "Anonymous users can submit cashback requests"
  ON cashback_submissions
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Add policy for anonymous users to read their own submissions (if they have a way to identify them)
-- This is mainly for future functionality where we might add session-based tracking
CREATE POLICY "Anonymous users can read submissions"
  ON cashback_submissions
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon
  USING (true);
